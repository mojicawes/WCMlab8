<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>
My project is a simple web application which implements a simple to-do list.  The list will be able to support
sorting.  A database will be kept of all users that want to use this application as well as their list items.
</p>

<h1>Minimal Functionality</h1>
An initial release that would have minimal useful functionality with my project would have to have at least one kind of list working.
Having user log-ins working would be the first step.  After that would be getting the database working in submitting list items
as well as retrieving them for display in a nice fashion.  Getting a final graphical design would be the final step (such as a banner image
completed as well as deciding on a color scheme).
